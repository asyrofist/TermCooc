Synonyms identification based on term co-occurrence

This repository contains code to identify synonyms based on term co-occurrence. The code implements co-occurrences based on the paper "Evaluating co-occurrence order for automatic thesaurus construction" by Roger Granada, Renata Vieira and Vera Lucia Strube de Lima. 


## First-order Co-occurrence

This co-occurrence is based on the work by Kaji *et al.* [1](#references)

## Second-order Co-occurrence

This co-occurrence is based on the work by Grefenstette [2](#references)

## Third (or higher)-order Co-occurrence

This co-occurrence is based on the work by Yang and Powers [3](#references)
